Human beings have been communicating in shorthand languages for years using different techniques such as Morse code, smoke signals, and other encrypted codes (Barker). The difference is that texting has brought on a \\\"code\\\" that people can decipher because most abbreviations are spelled phonetically; the slang is used in everyday life, and it is extremely convenient way to communicate (Barker).

In fact, the use of text message abbreviations is connected positively with literacy achievements (Smith). There has been research that using text abbreviations might have a correlation to children's reading and writing skills. Researchers at Coventry University have done a study on thirty-five eleven-year-olds relating their use of cell phones to their English reading, writing, and spelling skills. The researchers found that children who were better at spelling and writing were the ones who texted the most (Smith). There is no evidence to connect people who text to have a poor ability to use Standard English. Researcher Beverly Plester said in the Education Guardian Acticle::\\\"We are interested in discovering whether texting could be used positively to increase phonetic awareness in less able children, and perhaps increase their language skills, in a fun yet educational way,\\\" (Smith).

It’s easy to jump to the conclusion that students are unable to learn the use of proper English and also communicate with texts. However, Dr. Crispin Thurlow , a researcher in language and communication at the University of Washington, studied 135 nineteen-year-old students at Cardiff University and analyzed 544 of their text messages. Thurlow found only 20 percent who used abbreviations in their formal writing, and 35 percent who used apostrophes incorrectly in their messages (Barker). These findings contradict the notion that students are unable to tell the difference between different registers of English. The media contributes to the false idea that \\\"texting slang\\\" is used much more frequently than actual. Tim Shortis, a PhD candidate who studies text messaging as a vernacular language at London University's Institute of Education, said \\\"...

Now instead of passing notes, there is the option of sending electric messages with cellular phones.

Just imagine how many thumbs are typing messages on a daily basis.<\/p>\n<p>Most texters don't even need to blink when deciphering the texting and Instant Messaging (IMing) language used today. A couple of years ago, the craze was Instant messaging. But using this short-hand form of communication just on the computer was not enough.

There has been research that using text abbreviations might have a correlation to children's reading and writing skills. Researchers at Coventry University have done a study on thirty-five eleven-year-olds relating their use of cell phones to their English reading, writing, and spelling skills.
